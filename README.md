# Java Coding Practice


Working and Learning are different. Though you might work on the complex Java projects without any issues,
it often happens that core concepts are forgotten. Projects create Frameworks and as developer
we use the frameworks and do not bother how exactly they are developed using core concepts.

Normal operations, such as reading and writing to a file, you might not recall how it is done
and search online. Also, if you are following old way, it is essential
to learn the new way to do the same easily.

Date api is improved a lot, but do we really use them on daily basis!

Stream API and Lambda expressions are great additions. Should have good understanding
of the same.

Some organizations use algorithms extensively, but most of the cases, developers not developing
algorithms tends to forget them. Algorithms are a great way for developing better coding skills.
